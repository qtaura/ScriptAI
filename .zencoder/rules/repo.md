# AI Code Assistant Bot Information

## Summary
An intelligent code generation bot that can create scripts and code snippets from natural language prompts. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with minimal structure in place.

## Structure
The repository has a simple structure with the following components:
- **Root Directory**: Contains the README.md file with a brief project description
- **static/**: Directory likely intended for static assets (currently empty)
- **templates/**: Directory likely intended for template files (currently empty)

## Project Status
This project appears to be in the very early stages of development or setup. The repository structure suggests it might be intended as a web application (given the static and templates directories which are common in web frameworks), but no implementation files or configuration are present yet.

### Potential Implementation Details
Based on the directory structure:
- The project might be intended as a web application with static assets and templates
- Common web frameworks that use this structure include Flask, Django (Python), or various JavaScript frameworks
- No language-specific files, build configurations, or dependency management files are present yet

## Next Steps for Development
To continue development of this project, consider:
1. Selecting a programming language and framework
2. Setting up dependency management
3. Creating initial implementation files
4. Adding configuration for development environment
5. Implementing the core functionality for code generation
